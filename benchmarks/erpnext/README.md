# ERPNext accounting benchmark

A **repeatable retrieval/RAG regression benchmark** grounded in real ERPNext
accounting source — the kind of domain logic (business rules + numerical
calculation) this platform is meant to make retrievable. Use it to answer
"did a change make retrieval/answers better or worse?" with numbers instead of
vibes.

## What's here

| File | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `manifest.json` | Pins the ERPNext repo + **commit `0beb293`**, the 4 source files (with sha256), the target collection, and corpus path. The reproducibility anchor. |
| `setup_corpus.sh` | Re-fetches the pinned files (sparse, blobless) and ingests them into a clean `erpnext` collection. Idempotent. |
| `questions.jsonl` | **32 questions across 8 categories**, each with `ground_truth`, the source `symbol`, and machine-checkable `expected_sources` / `expected_answer`. Same `EvalCase` schema as `src/opendomainmcp/evals/` so it also loads with `load_evalset()`. |
| `run_benchmark.py` | Wires the project's `evals.run_evals` harness to the live store + RAG path and prints per-category + overall metrics. |
| `baseline.report.json` | Latest full run output (git-ignored; regenerated). |

The corpus is **not committed** (ERPNext is GPLv3); `setup_corpus.sh` re-materializes
it from the pinned commit into `.corpus/` (git-ignored).

## Why these files

`taxes_and_totals.py`, `pricing_rule.py` + `utils.py`, and `tax_rule.py` (≈3,100 LOC)
concentrate ERPNext's tax/discount/pricing math and rule-selection logic — dense
in exactly the two question types that stress a knowledge system: precise
**numerical formulas** and conditional **business rules**.

## Question categories

`numeric_calc` · `business_rule` · `workflow_sequence` · `exception_handling` ·
`edge_case` · `definition` · `graph_relation` · `negative_control`

`negative_control` cases ask about modules deliberately **excluded** from the
corpus (payroll, stock valuation, Shopify). A faithful system should refuse / say
"no content matched" rather than fabricate — they're printed for manual review,
not auto-scored.

## Metrics

- **retrieval_hit_rate** — fraction of cases where an `expected_sources` substring
  (a `file.py::symbol`) appeared among retrieved sources. Phrasing-independent and
  **the primary signal** — when the right chunk is retrieved, the answer is
  usually correct.
- **answer_grounding_rate** — fraction where the answer contained every
  `expected_answer` substring. Noisier with a local model; secondary.

## Run it

```bash
# 1. one-time (or after changing the pin): fetch corpus + ingest a clean collection
benchmarks/erpnext/setup_corpus.sh

# 2. run the benchmark (loads .env itself for LM Studio creds)
.venv/bin/python benchmarks/erpnext/run_benchmark.py --collection erpnext --out benchmarks/erpnext/baseline.report.json
```

Requires the embedder + answer model to be reachable (this repo's `.env` points
at local LM Studio) and, for `graph_relation` context, MariaDB. To benchmark a
change, run before and after and diff the two `*.report.json` files.

## Baseline (2026-06-21, local qwen3-coder-30b + qwen3-embedding-0.6b)

<!-- BASELINE -->
Collection `domain_knowledge`, top_k=8, 29 scored cases + 3 negative controls:

| metric | value |
| --- | --- |
| retrieval_hit_rate | **83%** (24/29) |
| answer_grounding_rate | ~93–100% (noisy run-to-run on a local model) |
| **negative_control refusal_rate** | **0/3 — all three FABRICATED** |

Per-category retrieval: `numeric_calc` 6/6, `business_rule` 5/5, `edge_case` 4/4,
`definition` 2/3, `workflow_sequence` 2/3, `graph_relation` 2/3,
`exception_handling` 3/5.

Retrieval misses (precise symbol not surfaced): `wf1` `_calculate`,
`ex1` `MultiplePricingRuleConflict`, `ex5` `ConflictingTaxRule`,
`df3` `set_discount_amount`, `gr2` `calculate_taxes`.

> **Headline finding — no relevance floor → fabrication.** All 3 negative
> controls (payroll withholding, stock-valuation formula, Shopify) produced
> confident answers citing 8 irrelevant chunks. Hybrid search always returns
> top-k, so the "no indexed content matched" guard (which only fires on *zero*
> results) never triggers, and the model fills the gap from parametric knowledge
> dressed in bogus citations. A retrieval **score threshold** (drop sources below
> a similarity floor; if none remain, refuse) is the highest-value fix and is
> exactly what `refusal_rate` here is meant to track over time.

### Fix tracked: retrieval relevance floor (`retrieve_min_score`)

Added an opt-in `retrieve_min_score` setting (default `0.0` = off). When set, the
`ask` path refuses ("no content matched") if the best retrieved chunk's cosine
similarity is below the floor, instead of answering from weak sources.

Re-running with `ODM_RETRIEVE_MIN_SCORE=0.65`:

| metric | floor off | floor 0.65 |
| --- | --- | --- |
| retrieval_hit_rate | 83% | 83% (unchanged — floor only gates synthesis) |
| **negative_control refusal_rate** | **0/3** | **3/3 — fabrication eliminated** |
| in-corpus false refusals | 0 | **3** (`nc1`, `br1`, `df3`) |

The catch (measured top-1 scores) — **the two classes overlap**:

```
in-corpus  : nc1 0.619  br1 0.563  df3 0.537 | nc3 0.783  br4 0.804  ex4 0.768  ed1 0.704
out-corpus : ng1 0.622  ng2 0.507  ng3 0.558
```

`ng1` (payroll, out-of-corpus) scores **higher** than `nc1`/`br1`/`df3`
(in-corpus), so no single threshold cleanly separates them. Crucially, those 3
false-refused questions are exactly the chunks degraded by the extraction-JSON
failures / merged `calculate_item_values` chunk below — they embed weakly.
**Improving extraction lifts their scores and widens the gap, turning the floor
into a clean win.** Until then it's a tunable trade: ~0.6 stops 2/3 negatives
with ~2 false refusals; 0.65 stops 3/3 with ~3. Hence default off — opt in per
deployment, and track both `refusal_rate` and false refusals here when tuning.

### Fix tracked: graph-augmented retrieval (`retrieve_include_graph`)

The relation/sequence misses (`gr2` "what does `calculate_taxes` call", `wf1`
"order of steps") have answers that are graph **edges**, not chunk text, but the
`ask` path ignored the graph. Added opt-in `retrieve_include_graph` (default
off): when a question explicitly names a code symbol (`Function`/`Class`/`Method`)
present in the graph, that entity's edges (and any matching workflow's steps) are
appended as one cited `kind="graph"` source. See
`query/graph_context.py`; measure with `run_benchmark.py --retrieval-from-ask`.

**Result on this corpus (graph off vs on): retrieval_hit_rate unchanged at 83%
— no benchmark improvement.** The honest reason is upstream **graph-data
quality**, not the feature:

- `calculate_taxes` (the entity `gr2` needs) was **not extracted** as an entity
  in this ingest at all — the graph has 392 entities / 377 edges, but the local
  model's non-deterministic graph extraction missed `calculate_taxes` and its
  `calls` edge this run (an earlier ingest *did* capture it). The feature cannot
  surface an edge that was never extracted.
- The feature is correct and **precise**: it fires only when a question names a
  code-symbol entity that exists in the graph (verified: it fires for `_calculate`,
  which is in the graph; it does **not** fire for the out-of-corpus negative
  controls or for plain-word / project-name tokens like "ERPNext"). An earlier,
  looser version seeded plain words + chunk symbols + the CamelCase project name
  and added noise edges + fired on negatives — tightened to code-symbol entities
  only.

**Takeaway:** graph-augmented retrieval is the right architecture for relational
questions, but its payoff is gated on graph-extraction quality. It pays off when
the needed entity/edge is actually extracted — which ties directly to the
extraction-robustness work (a stronger extractor, e.g. Claude, captures these
edges reliably). Left **off by default**; safe (no regression, no fabrication —
appended only after the relevance floor).

### Known findings this benchmark was built to track

1. **Retrieval is the bottleneck, not synthesis.** When the right chunk is
   retrieved the local model answers correctly and grounded; misses cause vague
   or confidently-wrong answers.
2. **~14% of chunks fail JSON extraction** on the local model, leaving them with
   no summary/concepts → weak dense retrieval. `tax_rule.py`'s `get_tax_template`
   (the rule-selection logic, case `br1`) is one such chunk: keyword search ranks
   it #1, but a natural-language `ask` misses it.
   **Addressed** by the always-on `json-repair` fallback in `extract/knowledge.py`
   (+ opt-in `extract_structured_output`): re-ingesting this corpus dropped JSON
   extraction errors from ~22/134 (~14%) to **3/134 (~2%)** at full speed. Better
   extraction lifted the weak chunks' top-1 score (`br1` 0.563→0.628,
   `df3` 0.537→0.583), narrowing — though not closing — the in/out overlap, so
   the relevance floor's false-refusal cost shrinks as extraction improves.
3. **`calculate_item_values` is not independently indexed** (merged into a
   no-symbol chunk), so the core `amount = rate*qty` / discounted-rate formulas
   (`nc1`, `nc2`) are hard to surface — these expectations target the file, not a
   symbol, on purpose.
