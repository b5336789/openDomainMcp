"""Publish role-specific MCP views as live HTTP (SSE) endpoints.

The MCP Builder UI used to only print a "start server" command. This module
mounts each view's :class:`~mcp.server.fastmcp.FastMCP` server as an ASGI sub-app
under ``/mcp/{view}`` (SSE transport) and exposes a small publish registry so the
UI can publish / unpublish views and discover their absolute endpoint URLs.

Mounting builds no context and opens no database connection: each view builds its
runtime context lazily, per request. A view that fails to mount is logged and
skipped so one bad view never aborts application startup (Fail-Loud via log).
